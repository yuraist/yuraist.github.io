            <h1 id="Terms and Conditions">Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>Last updated: April 4, 2023</p>
<p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”) govern your relationship with Nuta mobile application (the “Service”) operated by Nuta (“us”, “we”, or “our”).</p>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our Nuta mobile application (the “Service”).</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Subscriptions">Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Nuta cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Nuta customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Nuta with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Nuta to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Nuta will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Free Trial">Free Trial</h2>
<p>Nuta may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).</p>
<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Nuta until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
<p>At any time and without notice, Nuta reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Fee Changes">Fee Changes</h2>
<p>Nuta, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Nuta will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Refunds">Refunds</h2>
<p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Content">Content</h2>

<br>

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Changes">Changes</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
